# Integrating DocuSign with Upward Bound

In order to give as many students as possible access to Upward Bound and it's services, we decided to integrate the Docusign API to give students immediate access to the signup document. Students will request a signup document on the front-end by inputting their name and email address, and we process this by sending them an envelope to fill out and sign, while CC'ing it to our team to monitor.

Most of the code was generated by Docusign and we tweaked it to be used for our use-case.

# Running in Production

Make sure the private.key file is correct and present in the app folder and that the jwt_config.py file is present and filed out correctly.

It would also be best practice to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the base directory before deploying the production application, and when troubleshooting.

The file will be run by the Node.js backend server, which will take a user's name and email and run `python3 jwt_console.py "user@email.com" "Firstname Lastname"`

Any errors with this portion of the backend will be logged in the base directory to easily discover issues with the application.

# Notes for Future Developers

Consent may need to be updated periodically, have not yet solved the problem of logging in automatically to give consent.

We could also improve the Docusign experience by tagging the document, but for now the application will require users to use the Docusign application to tag the document manually.
